                        Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are designed to provide users with a fast, reliable, and
                        engaging experience, similar to native mobile applications. They use modern web technologies
                        such as Service Workers and Web App Manifest to offer offline functionality, making them
                        accessible and reliable in situations where users may have limited or unreliable internet
                        connectivity.

                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        PWAs are responsive, installable, and leverage native device features to provide an experience
                        that is comparable to that of native apps, making them a popular choice for businesses looking
                        to engage with their customers on the web.
